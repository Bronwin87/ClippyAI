**ClippyAI**
================

**Overview**

ClippyAI is an innovative productivity tool that revolutionizes the way you interact with your computer. This
application takes notes from your clipboard and sends them along with a task to Ollama, a popular local AI service.
After processed, the response will be either available in the clipboard, or will automatically be typed in 
the application the user is running.

**Features**

* **Highest Level of Data Privacy**: Your data stays your data and nothing leaves your PC. After installation, you can
even use this tool completely offline.
* **Clipboard Integration**: ClippyAI seamlessly integrates with your system's clipboard, capturing text instantly
after it is copied or cut. Users can send the clipboard contents along with one of the predefined or a custom task
to the Ollama API. After task execution, the clipboard contents will be overwritten with the output.
* **Desktop Notifications**: Notifications inform the user about the task status.
* **Cross-Platform Support**: Developed with .NET and Avalonia, ClippyAI runs on Windows and Linux (X11)
ensuring that users can enjoy its benefits regardless of their platform.

**Example Use Cases**

* Copy an email and let ClippyAI write the response
* Copy some code from an IDE to find an error
* Explain a compilcated text in more easy words
* Translate text to another language
